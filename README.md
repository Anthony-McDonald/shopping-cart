# Pixel Perfect #

This is my rendition of a shopping cart application for video games. It is a strictly frontend application, making use of the RAWG Games API for all games shown on the website. As this API does not contain price information due to all stores having different values, for the purposes of the project, all games have their price set to Â£9.99.

Upon opening the page, the user is greeted with a page with "open" in white text. On hover, the text expands and on click, the user is brought into the main page. I experimented with this for a while to find a look and feel that I was happy with, eventually settiling on what you can see: a retro styled text box that invites the user to click to find more.
## Search ##
Once the user is in the main page, they have two main ways of filtering to find games that they wish to purchase - via category or name.
### Category Search ###

Searching via category shows all games that meet that specific selection criteria. This was done through picking up on user click and sending a request to the RAWG api for whatever is clicked on, returning the games that suit the criteria. Working with the API proved challenging at first due to the difficulty of finding the particular numbers corresponding to each genre or platform. However, through reading the documentation as well as some old fahsioned trial and error, I was able to get this to work as expected.
### Name Search ###

Searching via name, on the other hand, was much more straight forward to implement. Using the search box at the top of the screen, the user inputs the title of the game they are looking for and presses their enter key. The application then reads the content of the input box and sends it through to the api, which returns a list of games that suit the name inserted into the input box. Thus triggering the frontend react elements to rerender the newly returned games onto the screen.
## Purchasing ##

Finally, users can add each individual game to their basket and 'purchase' whatever is in their basket (as it is a demo application, attempting to purchase just returns a message informing the user that it is in fact a demo application and that games cannot actually be bought). This involved lifting the state of the react components to pass through the individual information of each element into the sidebar, so that they can be displayed for the user to see.
